                <li><b>Learning Based Intrusion Detection System</b><br><br>
                    <p>Background of Project: With continuous developments in new technologies, the size of companies 
                        networks continues to grow, and so does its attack surface space. 
                        This problem is amplified by the growing cyber security threat and their 
                        continuously developing penetration techniques. Unfortunately, Network 
                        Operation Centers, which help monitor networks, are not scaling at the 
                        same rate, and that is why I decided to build a model that could predict 
                        whether a connection is a “good” (i.e., normal) or “bad” (i.e., DoS, probing). 
                        The model does this by extracting features from a TCP connection and has been 
                        built using a data size of approximately 4 million TCP connections.

                <li><b>Research Project in Computer Science Education</b><br><br>
                    <p>Background of Research: It has become increasingly apparent that CS students with 
                        different backgrounds can have very different experiences.  For example, 
                        early computing experiences are a strong predictor of success in an undergraduate 
                        computer science program, yet African Americans and LatinX students are less 
                        likely to have access to such experiences.  This project concerns access to special 
                        in-program experiences such as internships (e.g., CSE 197) and research 
                        (e.g., CSE 199), among others.  With the help of the Jacobs School, we have 
                        developed a 5-year data set of student enrollments in all kinds of CS courses 
                        at UCSD.  We will develop hypotheses about disparities in participation in 
                        special studies courses, and then test those hypotheses using statistical methods.
                        Based on the results, we will perform additional follow-up investigations, 
                        such as interviewing students, industry participants (who provide and interview 
                        for internship experiences), and instructors.</p>
