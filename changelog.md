Changes:

Updated my projects page, it previously only had 2 one sentence bullet points. I added content to two projects. One that included my machine learning project, the seond being the ungrad research that I was a part of. I also included a link to the ERSP program presentation. 
I also added an image in the project page for the research project that my team and I created, along with a description of the research.
I added 2 images in the machine learning section of the projects page, along with a project description.

I used some of the button options from font-awesome to iclude a fun button in the contact me section. 
I also changed the linkedIn text at the footer to a linkedIn logo like seen on many resume sites. 

I previously already spent time filling in the content for my CV, so this section completed.


I also include a google analytics script near the top of my main pages in the head section which links to my site and allows me to track user activity on my site to a certain degree. 

I added this script instead of others because I like the idea of being able to improve on my site layout based on user experience data. I also don't have a twitter to link, and I wouldn't want to like my social media to my resume site anyway.
